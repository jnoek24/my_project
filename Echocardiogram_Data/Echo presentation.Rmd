Generated echocardiography data on the mice we were using

- Knockout vs Wild type

Very small data set

- Easy to work with

Needed to be done and was good practice 

---
Started by importing the proper package and the data
```
library(readxl)
EchoCardiograms_data_for_R <- read_excel("Echocardiogram_Data/EchoCardiograms data for R.xls", 
    sheet = "Sheet3")
View(EchoCardiograms_data_for_R)
EchoC_data <- EchoCardiograms_data_for_R #Renamed for easier use
names(EchoC_data)
```
The data was fairly clean since I made the csv file myself

---
Investigated and manipulated the data further with the Tidyverse package
```
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

EchoC_data %>%
  select(ID, Genotype, Vol_s, Vol_d, EF, FS, starts_with('Dia'), starts_with('mean'), starts_with('LV'), Peak_grad, Peak_vel, starts_with('Aor'), brach., -starts_with('RV'), -starts_with('PA'))

anyNA(EchoC_data)
apply(EchoC_data, 2, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```
---
Goal is to generate plots with this to show data in a digestible fashion
```
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(EchoC_data, aes(x = Genotype, y = Vol_s)) + geom_boxplot()

LV_Sys_Vol <- ggplot(EchoC_data, aes(x = Genotype, y = Vol_s)) + geom_violin() + theme_bw() + ylab("Left Ventricular Systolic Volume (uL)") + 
  scale_x_discrete(label = c("Wild Type", "Mutant")) + ggtitle("June 2018 Systolic Volume Variation") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom="point", shape = 18, size  = 3) + stat_summary(fun.y=median,  geom = "point", shape = 3, size = 3, color="blue") 

LV_Sys_Vol
```
Liked the layout of violin plot better than the boxplot
- More informative

---
Have two sets of data I am working with

Use same methods to import and fix data for use
```
library(readxl)
edited_new_echo_r <- read_excel("Echocardiogram_Data/edited_new_echo_r.xls", 
                                sheet = "Sept 2018")
apply(edited_new_echo_r, 2, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
library(tidyverse)
fixed_new_echo <- new_echo_r %>% drop_na()
anyNA(fixed_new_echo)
'''

Need stats on data
T-Test is all we really need comparing change
